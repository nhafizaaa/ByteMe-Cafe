<h1 align="center"> ByteMe Cafe Ordering System </h1>
<br>
<p>This project was developed to fulfill my coursework for web development subject during my degree. The idea to develop this kind of system came from a basic e-commerce that exists in the market but with some modification that had been made to make it look like any available online food ordering system. </p>
